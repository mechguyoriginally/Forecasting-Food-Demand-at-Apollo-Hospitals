# Forecasting-Food-Demand-at-Apollo-Hospitals
Apollo Hospitals, founded in 1983, is one of India's leading hospital chains. In 2014, Apollo operated 32 hospitals across the country. The Apollo Hospital in Bangalore is the focus of this project. Dr. Ananth Rao, the quality head, was concerned about the food bill, which accounted for 4% of the overall cost, and wanted to create a forecasting model to estimate the demand for food and beverages given to patients for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Accurate forecasting will assist them in minimising food waste, resulting in a lower food bill. Dr. Rao believed that the need for food was determined by the hospital's occupancy level (number of in-patients). Furthermore, he predicted a short-term trend in food requirements because patients are likely to order identical food during their hospital stay - this is due to dietary limitations as well as the fact that individuals do not want to experiment with food in a hospital atmosphere. The patient profile in the hospital is unlikely to change much over time, hence the food trend is unlikely to change significantly over time.
